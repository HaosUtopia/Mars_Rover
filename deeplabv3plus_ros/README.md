This is a ROS package of [DeeplabV3+](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02611). Most of core algorighm code was based on [Deeplab implementation by tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab).

## Requirements

- ROS kinetic
- TensorFlow >= 1.14.0
- CUDA >= 10.0
- cuDNN >= 7.4.1

For more information, please visit this [link](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/deeplab/g3doc/installation.md).

## Training

This repositry doesn't contain the code for training. If you want to train the model on your class definition or dataset, please refer to this [link](https://www.programmersought.com/article/4188126074/).
